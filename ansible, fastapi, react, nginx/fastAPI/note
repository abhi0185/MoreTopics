install

pip3 install fastapi uvicorn
or
python3.7 -m pip install fastapi uvicorn	# as python version should above or equal 3.7
------------------------------
FastAPI framework mostly similar as RESTApi but more faster
it uses Asynchronous(ASGI) method, where RESTApi uses Synchronous(WSGI) method
we can write api using FastAPI framework and run server using uvicorn(which can run api in asynchronous)
FastAPI provide support of swagger docs(use as postman. it creates docs for you)
FastAPI have pydantic library which we can use for data validation and settings management.(no need to manually validate post request data)

------------------------------
Synchronous / Asynchronous

Synchronous : 	will work together and wait for other task to finish their work to move forward
Asynchronous : 	will work seperately and dont wait for other task to move forward

-----------------------------
To run a FastAPI application with Uvicorn, 
you typically create your FastAPI application in a Python file and then use Uvicorn to serve it. 
For example, if you have a file named main.py containing your FastAPI application, 
you can use Uvicorn to serve it by running the following command in your terminal:

uvicorn main:app --reload
or
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001					# to get same result in localhost
or
uvicorn fastApi_provision:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001	# to get same result in ipaddress also 

-------------------------------
Swagger docs:
Once you run application, by adding /docs after http://127.0.0.1:8001/ you will get swagger docs.
for example http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs or http://127.0.0.1:8001/redoc
